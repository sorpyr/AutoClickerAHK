# AutoClickerAHK
A simple, portable auto-clicker made with AutoHotkey and compiled into a standalone executable.

# How it works
Run the executable, then hold down the 4th mouse button (the back button) to start auto-clicking. Release the button to stop.

#  Which button is the 4th mouse button?

The 4th mouse button is commonly known as the "back" button — typically the side button farthest from the left-click button on your mouse.

# What do I need?

A mouse with side buttons (forward/back buttons) is required to use this auto-clicker.

# Features

Since it’s built with AutoHotkey, the script includes handy built-in controls accessible via the system tray icon:
* Pause Script – temporarily pause clicking without closing the program

* Exit – close the autoclicker completely

# Troubleshooting

If the executable doesn’t work on your system, try:

* Installing AutoHotkey from https://www.autohotkey.com/

* Running or compiling the script yourself from the source *.ahk* file
